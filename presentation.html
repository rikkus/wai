# Web Application Insecurity
## Outside the OWASP top 10

???

If you're not already familiar with the OWASP project, it's a great resource
on security issues you should be aware of as a developer, wherever you operate
in the 'stack'.

We're going to talk about a newer web security issue, presented first in
November 2014, but worth covering because it's fun to understand how it
works and to see how easy it is to fall prey to - and to fix.

# AJAX search in action

???

There's a new Web 2.0 technique around, called AJAX, where you can call
back to your server without a whole page refresh.

# Javascript

```javascript
$.getJSON("/s/q/" + q,
  function(data) {
    $("#results").empty();
    if (data.people.length == 0)
    {
      $("#results").append("<div>Nothing found</div>");
    }
    else
    {
      $.each(data.people, function(i,item){
        $("#results").append("<div>" + item + "</div>");
      });
    }
  }
);
```

# MVC Controller

```ruby
require 'json'

class SController &lt; Controller

  set_layout nil

  def q(query)
    response.header['Content-Type'] = 'application/json;'
    # Defeat XSS (Malicious user upload displayed as if part of web page)
    response.header['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment'
    { q: query, people: find(query) }.to_json
  end

  private

  def find(query)
    ["Rik Hemsley", "Steven Pears", "Jamie Keeling", "Jordan Gray"].select {
      |name|
      name.upcase.include?(query.upcase)
    }
  end

end

# XSS from a download?

## [Oh yes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3922872/how-can-xss-be-avoided-in-html-downloads)
## (Oh no!)

---

# Response

```javascript
{
  q: "r",
  people: ["Rik Hemsley", "Steven Pears", "Jordan Gray"]
}
```

---

# Response headers

```http
Content-Type: application/json;
Content-Length: 63
Content-Disposition: attachment
```

---

# What if we browse to it?

![Image](images/download.png)

--

```javascript
{"q":"r", "people":["Rik Hemsley","Steven Pears","Jordan Gray"]}
```

---

# But can we run it?

![Image](images/bat.png)

---

# And this will work how?

--

```
C:\>{"q":"r", "people":["rik hemsley","steven pears","jordan gray"]}
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
```

--

## We don't need all of it
```
C:\>{"q":"r"
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
```
---
# What about a command?
```
C:\>{"q":"echo hi"
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
```
--
## But we had an effect
``` 
C:\>echo %ERRORLEVEL%
9009
```
